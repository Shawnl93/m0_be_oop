# Self Evaluation

- This final CFU encompassed everything you've learned in Mod 0, and maybe even required some learning outside of what you've explicitly been taught. How did it feel as you faced these challenges? It made me felt like i didnt know anything or i completely missed something but once i was able to get the answer it felt very accomplishing.
- How is your workflow going, in terms of taking breaks, staying focused, etc.? still trying to get the hang of it but im getting the hang of it.
- What do you need to do to be ready for intense technical lessons and challenges like this, for 6 hours/day next week? What support do you need? Definitely be more confident in my self..and just understand everything we learned can be used with "today's" lesson.. and not get hard stuck trying to just use "today's" lesson
